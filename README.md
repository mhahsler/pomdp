Provides an interface to [pomdp-solve](http://www.pomdp.org/code/index.html), a solver for Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDP) origninally written by Anthony R. Cassandra. The package enables the user to simply define all components of a POMDP model and solve the problem using the finite grid method. The package also contains functions to analyze and visualize the solutions (e.g., the optimal policy).
