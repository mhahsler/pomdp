Description: Provides the infrastructure to define and analyze the solutions of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDP) models. The package includes pomdp-solve to solve POMDPs using a variety of exact and approximate value iteration algorithms. Smallwood and Sondik (1973) <doi:10.1287/opre.21.5.1071>.
